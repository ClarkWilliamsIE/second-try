                <p>The Makertruck Initiative is a groundbreaking portable STEAM education platform that aims to transform the learning landscape in Aotearoa. By collaborating with partner schools during year-long residencies, we develop ambitious, high-tech, and creative engineering projects that challenge students to acquire new skills and implement them.</p>
                <p>This initiative bridges the digital divide by providing access to cutting-edge technology and learning experiences for students who may not have had the opportunity otherwise.</p>
